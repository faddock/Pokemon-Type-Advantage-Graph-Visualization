# **CS 225 Final Project - Pokémon Type Advantage Graph Visualization**

## **Team Contract (ccl4-harryc3-devbp2-suyashn2)**

### **Communication**
**Team Meetings** Our team will meet twice a week on Saturdays from 10am to 12pm and Thursdays from 3 to 5pm. We will meet at the CIF or, if someone is not able to attend, through Discord. Notes will be taken via Google Docs, and the notetaker (who will record when the group will meet) will rotate every week, starting with Harry. 

**Assistance** If a team member needs assistance, they can be contacted through Discord or email. Replies should be within 3-5 hours.

**Respect** To ensure that everyone has a chance to speak, if someone has something to say, that person will give a signal that they want to chime an idea in. If someone has a question or is stuck with anything, our group members will take a step back and explain it until all team members are at the same point.

### **Collaboration**
**Work Distribution** The deliverables for each week will be determined by the whole team; whatever part is best for each individual team member will be the part that they focus on. If one person finishes their deliverable earlier, they should help another member with their deliverable.

**Time Commitment** Each team member should work on the project for at least two hours every week; although this does not seem like a small amount of time, we all know that each of us will probably pick a single day to cram in all of our work. If one person’s deliverable takes more time than expected, other members of the team should help them. 
If one member of the team is not meeting the expectations of the group, they may be positively encouraged to do their part; if the bad habit continues, the head TA may be called in to deal with the problematic team member.

**Conflict Resolution** All conflicts that occur in the CIF will be decided by a race from the basement of the CIF to the fourth floor of the CIF via the stairs. Conflicts that occur online will be decided by who can create a for-loop that prints the numbers 1-10 in C++ the fastest.
